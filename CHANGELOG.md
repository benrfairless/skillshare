# Changelog

## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-31

### Breaking Changes

**Command Rename: `pull <target>` → `collect <target>`**

For clearer command symmetry, `pull` is now exclusively for git operations:

| Before | After | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `pull claude` | `collect claude` | Collect skills from target to source |
| `pull --all` | `collect --all` | Collect from all targets |
| `pull --remote` | `pull` | Pull from git remote |

### New Command Symmetry

| Operation | Commands | Direction |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Local sync | `sync` / `collect` | Source ↔ Targets |
| Remote sync | `push` / `pull` | Source ↔ Git Remote |

```
Remote (git)
   ↑ push    ↓ pull
Source
   ↓ sync    ↑ collect
Targets
```

### Migration

```bash
# Before
skillshare pull claude
skillshare pull --remote

# After
skillshare collect claude
skillshare pull
```
